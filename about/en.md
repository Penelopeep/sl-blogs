# About Seelen

## Our Story

**Seelen Inc** was founded in 2024 by **Eythan D. Moreira**, a developer driven by the belief that software should adapt to people, not the other way around. What began as a personal project — **Seelen UI** — evolved into a company dedicated to creating tools that blend functionality, aesthetics, and creative freedom. Today, our team works to democratize digital customization, empowering users to transform their technological environments into authentic extensions of their identity.

## Philosophy & Values

We believe software can be a catalyst for creativity and personal growth. Our core principles are:

1. **Deep Customization**\
   We design tools that users can reshape down to the smallest detail, from interfaces to workflows. We reject the idea of "one-size-fits-all" solutions — everyone deserves a unique digital environment.

2. **Practical Creativity**\
   Our solutions are built for artists, designers, professionals, and the curious. They aren’t just tools but platforms for experimentation and bringing ideas to life.

3. **Lifelong Learning**\
   Personal and professional growth should never stagnate. We integrate educational resources into our products and encourage users to explore new skills — whether languages, coding, or design. As Eythan says: *"Learning isn’t a phase in life — it is life itself."*

4. **Open Source & Community**\
   We champion open-source software and transparent collaboration. Most of our tools are modular and open-source, allowing developers and users to contribute, adapt, and improve the code to meet their needs.

## Our Approach

At **Seelen Inc**, we specialize in software built on three principles:

* **Flexibility over rigidity**: Our programs feature a **modular architecture** where every component can be activated, deactivated, or reconfigured. This enables fully personalized experiences without locked features.
* **Purposeful aesthetics**: Every visual element serves a function but never at the cost of beauty or harmony.
* **Evolutionary adaptability**: Our products grow with users, integrating new features without compromising their original essence.

## Clear Commitments

* **Open source by default**: 80% of our software is open-source, fostering transparency and collective innovation.
* **Accessible documentation**: Every tool includes detailed guides, practical examples, and well-documented APIs to simplify advanced modifications.
* **Ethics over algorithms**: We don’t sell user data or employ dark patterns. Privacy is baked into our design.

## What Defines Us

While many companies treat customization as a feature, for us, it’s the foundation. We reject generic solutions in favor of frameworks users make their own through:

* **Modular tools**: Combine features like blocks to build your ideal setup.
* **Accessible APIs**: Integrate our software with other services or create custom extensions.
* **Active communities**: Spaces for sharing templates, tutorials, and innovative user-driven solutions.
