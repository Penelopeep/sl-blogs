# Seelen's Poem

Where ravens cawl\
Where ideas nest on the Moon\
Where a tree grows\
Where the souls born from the sun

An egg was hatched\
A child was born\
A seed was planted\
A tree has grown

raven that cawl\
raven that fly\
raven who code\
raven who fight

leave the group\
accept the change\
leave the fear\
accept the pain

grow my dear tree\
alone in a desert earth\
soon you will bear fruit\
soon you will end

far away I stay\
enought to see my earth\
going to say bye to my brain\
going to say hi to my dead\

Where the souls die in the sun\
Where the trees dry up in the moon\
Where the ideas dissappear in the sky\
Where the ravens cawl one more time
