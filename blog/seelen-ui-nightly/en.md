## What is the Nightly Channel?

The Nightly release channel is a specialized build of Seelen UI that is
automatically generated with each new commit to the `master` branch. This
ensures that the Nightly version always incorporates the latest changes,
features, and bug fixes, even if they have not yet undergone extensive testing.

## Release Variants

Nightly releases include two distinct variants:

1. **Standard Version** – The regular build of the application, suitable for
   general testing.
2. **Debug Version** – Identified by the `-debug` suffix (e.g.,
   `Seelen.UI_2.0.10+20241213134120_x64-setup-debug.exe`), this variant is
   optimized for developers and testers working on themes, plugins, or widgets
   compatible with Seelen UI.

## Benefits

- **Early Access to Features** – Test the latest improvements before they reach
  stable releases.
- **Proactive Issue Reporting** – Help identify and resolve bugs early in the
  development cycle.
- **Rapid Development Feedback** – Contribute to refining Seelen UI by providing
  real-time insights.

## Limitations

- **Potential Instability** – Nightly builds may include unfinished features or
  unresolved bugs.
- **Not Recommended for Production** – These builds are intended for testing
  purposes only and should not be used in critical environments.

## How to Enable the Nightly Channel

To switch to the Nightly release channel:

1. Open **Settings** > **Extras** or **Information** > **Update Channel**.
2. Select **Nightly** from the available options.
