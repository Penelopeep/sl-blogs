## **What is this?**

The nightly release channel is a special build of our project that is automatically constructed every time a new commit is made to the `master` branch. This ensures that the nightly version always includes the latest changes, features, and bug fixes, even if they have not yet undergone thorough testing.

## **Release Variants**

Within the nightly releases, there are two variants available:

1. **Normal Version:** This is the standard build of the application.
2. **Debug Version:** Identified with the `-debug` prefix (e.g., `Seelen.UI_2.0.10+20241213134120_x64-setup-debug.exe`), this version is specially tailored for developers and testers of themes, plugins, or widgets that the application supports.

## **enefits**

- **Early Feedback:** By using the nightly channel, you can test the latest changes and provide feedback early in the development process.
- **Rapid Iteration:** Allows the team to quickly identify and address issues before they reach a wider audience in stable releases.

## **Limitations**

- **Potential Instability:** Nightly builds may contain incomplete features or unresolved issues.
- **Not Production-Ready:** These builds are intended for testing and feedback, not for use in production environments.

## **How to Access the Nightly Release**

To access the nightly builds, enable the nightly release channel in the application settings:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Extras** or **Information** > **Update Channel**.
2. Select the **Nightly** option.
